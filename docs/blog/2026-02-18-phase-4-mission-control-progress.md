# Phase 4 Progress: Mission Control Became Operational

Phase 4 started with API contracts and ended with a usable Mission Control surface:

- contract-first API + shared typed payloads
- operator dashboard foundation (org/profile/activity)
- event-driven kanban and approval stream
- economics + ROI + conversation viewer

The key process win was sequencing. We used contracts first, then deterministic frontend behavior, then documentation and narrative closure. That reduced rework while keeping each slice independently verifiable.

By end of Phase 4, the remaining gap is transport integration and operational hardening in the next phase, not product-surface ambiguity.
